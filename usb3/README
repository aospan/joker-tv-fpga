Daisho USB Core

This is an open source USB 3.0 core.  It can be used to implement a USB device
on an FPGA with a USB 3.0 transceiver such as the TUSB1310A.  It can also
operate in USB 2.0 mode with a ULPI transceiver.

This core is being developed for the Altera Cyclone IV.  Operation on other
FPGA platforms may be possible with some work.

Planned functionality includes device (not host) operation in USB 2.0 and 3.0
(including SuperSpeed) modes.

The core is part of Project Daisho but may be used on other platforms.
